# Online Interactive Resume

This no longer hosts the interative resume. I am working to set up my personal site with github pages and jekyll.
<!--Online resume sample with interactive elements like graph, google map, navigation. The resume is responsive to device size.

## Setup

* The app is hosted on [swatilk.github.io](http://swatilk.github.io). Click on the link to see the resume.
* Click on the navigation buttons to navigate to the respective part, on the app. -->
